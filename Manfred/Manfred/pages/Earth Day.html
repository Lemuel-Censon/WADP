<p id="edcaption">Earth day comes only once a year, and what better way to celebrate and honor the beautiful Earth we live on by learning more about it? Here are 30 fun and interesting facts about the earth that will entertain and make you appreciate the vastness of Mother Earth and what our planet has to offer.<br>Click <span id="triviadisplay" onclick="displayTrivia()">HERE</span> to know more about our Earth!</p>
<div id="trivia">	
	<ol>
        <li>When you are standing, you are actually moving through space at <span class="number">1,000</span> miles per hour.</span></li>
		<li>The Earth moves around the sun at <span class="number">67,000</span> miles per hour.</li>
		<li>The Earth is approximately <span class="number">4.53 billion</span> years old.</li>
		<li>The Earth and its rocks recycle themselves by transforming from magma to rock to sedimentary rock to metamorphic rock to magma again.</li>
		<li>Like the Earth experiences earthquakes, the moon experiences “moonquakes”.</li>
		<li>The largest earthquake in recorded U.S. history was the magnitude <span class="number">9.2</span> earthquake in Prince William Sound, Alaska in 2011.</li>
		<li>The hottest reported spot on the Earth is in El Azizia, Libya, where NASA recorded a temperature of <span class="number">136</span> degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
		<li>The coldest reported spot on the Earth is in Antarctica, where temperatures reach as low as minus <span class="number">100</span> degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
		<li>The lowest temperature ever recorded was in Russia’s Vostok Station, where temperatures reached minus <span class="number">128.6</span> degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
		<li>The Antarctic ice gap contains <span class="number">70 percent</span> of the Earth’s fresh water and <span class="number">90 percent</span> of its ice.</li>
		<li>Over the past <span class="number">20 million</span> years, the Earth experiences pole reversal ever <span class="number">200,000</span> to <span class="number">300,000</span> years, although the last one hasn’t occurred in over twice this time.</li>
		<li>The world’s longest mountain range is under water. It is called the mid-ocean ridge and stretches <span class="number">40,389</span> miles.</li>
		<li>The deepest point on the ocean floor is <span class="number">35,813</span> feet in the Mariana Trench.</li>
		<li>The deepest point not covered by the ocean is <span class="number">8,382</span> feet at the Bentley Subglacial Trench in Antarctica.</li>
		<li>There are three deadly lakes: the Nyos, Monoun and Kivu.</li>
		<li>The Earth may once have not been blue, but purple.</li>
		<li>A single lightning strike can heat the air to some <span class="number">54,000</span> degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
		<li>Humans have only explored <span class="number">5 percent</span> of the Earth’s oceans, which cover some <span class="number">70 percent</span> of the Earth’s surface.</li>
		<li>Seas hold more than <span class="number">20 million tons</span> of gold.</li>
		<li>The Earth is some <span class="number">93</span> million miles from the sun.</li>
		<li>The Earth is not a perfect sphere. As the Earth spins, gravity points toward the center of our planet, and a centrifugal force pushes outward.</li>
		<li>At the equator, the circumference of the globe is <span class="number">24,901</span> miles long.</li>
		<li>The largest confirmed stalagmite in the world can be found in Cuba in the Cuevo San Martin Infierno, which rises <span class="number">220</span> feet tall.</li>
		<li>The Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from huge blasts of deadly solar radiation, has been weakening over the past six months, according to data collected by a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite array called Swarm.</li>
		<li>Earth may once have had two moons. A teensy second moon — spanning about <span class="number">750</span> miles wide — may have orbited the Earth before it catastrophically slammed into the other one.</li>
		<li>At the Death Valley, a perfect storm can move rocks sometimes weighing tens or hundreds of pounds.</li>
		<li>Coral reefs support the most species per unit area of any of the planet's ecosystems, rivaling rain forests. And while they are made up of tiny coral polyps, together coral reefs are the largest living structures on the Earth — a community of connected organisms — with some visible even from space.</li>
		<li>The lowest point on land is the Dead Sea between Jordan, Israel and the West Bank. The surface of this super-salty lake is <span class="number">1,388</span> feet below sea level.
		<li>On a daily basis, about <span class="number">100 tons</span> of interplanetary material (mostly in the form of dust) drifts down to the Earth's surface. The tiniest particles are released by comets as their ices vaporize near the sun.</li>
		<li>The largest volcanic eruption recorded by humans occurred in April 1815, the peak of the explosion of Mount Tambora. The eruption ranked <span class="number">7</span> (or "super-colossal") on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), which goes from 1 to 8 and is somewhat akin to the magnitude scale for earthquakes.</li>
