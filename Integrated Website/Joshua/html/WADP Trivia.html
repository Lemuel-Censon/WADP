                                and biological molecules are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. It may cause diseases, allergies
                                and also death of humans or other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may
                                damage the natural or built environment. Human activity and natural processes can both generate
                                air pollution. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's
                                worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places
                                report. According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, air pollution in 2012 caused
                                the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide, a rough estimate echoed by one from the
                                International Energy Agency. Common pollutants include but are not limited to: Carbon dioxide
                                (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur oxides (SO), Nitrogen Oxides (NO). How can we solve this

                        <div class="panel-body pull-left"> Water pollution is a major global problem. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource
                            policy at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested
                            that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases, and that it accounts
                            for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily. India and China are two countries with high
                            levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness
                            (including waterborne diseases) every day. About 90% of the water in the cities of China is polluted.
                            As of 2007, half a billion Chinese have no access to safe drinking water. In addition to the
                            acute problems of water pollution in developing countries, developed countries also continue
                            to struggle with pollution problems. For example, in a report on water quality in the United
                            States in 2009, 44% of assessed stream miles, 64% of assessed lake acres, and 30% of assessed
                            bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted.

                </div>
                <div id="landpoll" class="collapse in">
                    <div class="panel-body pull-left">There are many causes of land pollution. Some of which include: Deforestation, overcrowded landfills,
                        agricultural activities, industrialisation, construction activities, nuclear waste and sewage treatment.Firstly,
                        Deforestation carried out to create dry lands is one of the major concerns. Land that is once converted
                        into a dry or barren land, can never be made fertile again, whatever the magnitude of measures to
                        redeem it are. Land conversion, meaning the alteration or modification of the original properties
                        of the land to make it use-worthy for a specific purpose is another major cause. This hampers the
                        land immenselyand constantly wastes land. Unused available land over the years turn barren; this
                        land then cannot be used. So in search of more land, potent land is hunted and its indigenous state
                        is compromised with.Secondly, With the growing human population, the demand for food has increased
                        considerably. Farmers often use highly toxic fertilizers and pesticides to get rid off insects, fungi
                        and bacteria from their crops. However, overuse of these chemicals result in contamination and poisoning
                        of soil.Third, Each household produces tonnes of garbage each year. Garbage like aluminum, plastic,
                        paper, cloth, wood is collected and sent to the local recycling unit. Items that cannot be recycled
                        become a part of landfills that hamper the beauty of the city and cause land pollution.Fourth, Due
                        to increase in demand for food, shelter and housing, more goods are produced. This results in the
                        creation of more waste that needs to be disposed of. To meet the demand of the growing population,
                        more industries were developed which leads to deforestation. Research and development paved the way
                        for modern fertilizers and chemicals that were highly toxic and led to soil contamination.Fifth,
                        Due to urbanization, large amount of construction activities that take place results in large waste
                        articles like wood, metal, bricks, plastic that can be seen by naked eyes outside any building or
                        office which is under construction. Sixth, Nuclear plants can produce huge amounts of energy through
                        nuclear fission and fusion. The left over radioactive material contains harmful and toxic chemicals
                        that can affect human health. Thus, they are dumped beneath the earth to avoid any casualty.Finally,
                        Large amounts of solid waste is leftover once the sewage has been treated. The leftover material
                        is sent to landfill sites which end up in polluting the environment.

                <div class="panel-body pull-left">So, how do we solve our major arising environmentla problems? A good way is to start reducing your waste
                    by learning these simple steps: Do some research on the 3 rules of recycling, use reusable bags, make
                    a meal plan, use reusable containers, learn to repair things rather than discarding them and stop buying
                    water bottles and using paper cups. How do these help? Well, learning to recycle helps to reduce the
                    amount of waste you produce. Using reusable bags reduces the waste of one time use plastic bags, saving
                    the enivornment as plastic is non-biodegradable, which means they take a long time to decompose naturally.
                    Meal plans help reduce food wastage as you are able to eat everything you planned without wastage. Using
                    reusable containers instead of throwing them away reduces waste produced. For example, reusing glass
                    jars to store cooking items like salt/pepper. Buying high quality items and learning to repair them when
                    they are broken reduces waste as compared to using disposable items that contributes to pollution. Water
                    bottles and paper coffee cups are huge wastes of material. Buy a durable water bottle and a cute coffee
                    thermos so you can take your beverages wherever you please. You’ll find yourself feeling a lot more hydrated
                    and a lot less wasteful.

                        There are many things you can reuse from everyday waste in your homes. Some examples are: Use a gallon milk jug to water
                        the roots of garden plants without standing there with a hose: Poke small holes in the bottom of
                        the jug and bury it; fill with water for slow and steady irrigation. Place old silica gel packets
                        with personal papers and important documents to protect them from moisture and mildew. Humidity and
                        light are deleterious to printed photos; tackle the moisture part by storing photos with silica gel
                        packets. You can also reuse water used to rinse rice to water your plants as they are filled with
                        nutrients.

                <div class="panel-body pull-left text-justify">Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials,
                    thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).Recyclable
                    materials include many kinds of glass, paper, and cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, and electronics.
                    The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food or garden waste—is also considered
                    recycling. Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside,
                    then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing. Therefore, we are
                    encouraged not to throw away recyclable materials but instead throw them away into recycling bins so
                    that they can be remade into other products. For example, used office paper can be converted into new
                    office paper while used polystyrene foam can be made into new polystyrene.
