                                    Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and also death of humans or other living organisms such as animals and food crops,
                                    and may damage natural or built environments. Human activity and natural processes can
                                    both generate air pollution. Some examples being gases produced by car exhausts and Sulfur
                                    Dioxide produced by factories. Also, mammals like us produce Methane from time to time,
                                    contributing to global warming as it is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases absorb and
                                    trap heat, causing the Earth to become warmer, effectively slowly melting the North and
                                    south poles, destroying local animals like the Polar Bear's habitat. Nitrogen oxides
                                    and Sulfur dioxide mixes with water molecules in the air to condense and form acids.
                                    These acids shower done as acid rain, corroding metal and buildings. Common pollutants
                                    in the air include but are not limited to: Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO),
                                    Sulfur oxides (SO), Nitrogen Oxides (NO). How can we solve this arising problem?

                                Water pollution is a major global problem. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels
                                (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution
                                is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases, and that it accounts for the deaths
                                of more than 14,000 people daily. India and China are two countries with high levels of water
                                pollution: An estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness (including
                                waterborne diseases) every day. About 90% of the water in the cities of China is polluted.
                                As of 2007, half a billion Chinese have no access to safe drinking water. In addition to
                                the acute problems of water pollution in developing countries, developed countries also continue
                                to struggle with pollution problems. For example, in a report on water quality in the United
                                States in 2009, 44% of assessed stream miles, 64% of assessed lake acres, and 30% of assessed
                                bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted. Water pollution is mostly caused
                                by discharges from sewage treatement plants, factories or city storm drains.

                                There are many causes of land pollution. Some of which include: Deforestation, overcrowded landfills, agricultural activities,
                                industrialisation, construction activities, nuclear waste and sewage treatment.Firstly, Deforestation
                                carried out to create dry lands is one of the major concerns. Land that is once converted
                                into a dry or barren land, can never be made fertile again, whatever the magnitude of measures
                                to redeem it are. Land conversion, meaning the alteration or modification of the original
                                properties of the land to make it use-worthy for a specific purpose is another major cause.
                                This hampers the land immensely and constantly wastes land. Unused available land over the
                                years turn barren; this land then cannot be used. So in search of more land, potent land
                                is hunted and its indigenous state is compromised with.Secondly, With the growing human population,
                                the demand for food has increased considerably. Farmers often use highly toxic fertilizers
                                and pesticides to get rid off insects, fungi and bacteria from their crops. However, overuse
                                of these chemicals result in contamination and poisoning of soil.Third, Each household produces
                                tonnes of garbage each year. Garbage like aluminum, plastic, paper, cloth, wood is collected
                                and sent to the local recycling unit. Items that cannot be recycled become a part of landfills
                                that hamper the beauty of the city and cause land pollution.Fourth, Due to increase in demand
                                for food, shelter and housing, more goods are produced. This results in the creation of more
                                waste that needs to be disposed of. To meet the demand of the growing population, more industries
                                were developed which leads to deforestation. Research and development paved the way for modern
                                fertilizers and chemicals that were highly toxic and led to soil contamination.Fifth, Due
                                to urbanization, large amount of construction activities that take place results in large
                                waste articles like wood, metal, bricks, plastic that can be seen by naked eyes outside any
                                building or office which is under construction. Sixth, Nuclear plants can produce huge amounts
                                of energy through nuclear fission and fusion. The left over radioactive material contains
                                harmful and toxic chemicals that can affect human health. Thus, they are dumped beneath the
                                earth to avoid any casualty.Finally, Large amounts of solid waste is leftover once the sewage
                                has been treated. The leftover material is sent to landfill sites which end up in polluting
                                the environment.

                            So, how do we solve our major arising environmental problems? A good way is to start reducing your waste by learning these
                            simple steps: Do some research on the 3 rules of recycling, use reusable bags, make a meal plan,
                            use reusable containers, learn to repair things rather than discarding them and stop buying water
                            bottles and using paper cups. How do these help? Well, learning to recycle helps to reduce the
                            amount of waste you produce. Using reusable bags reduces the waste of one time use plastic bags,
                            saving the enivornment as plastic is non-biodegradable, which means they take a long time to
                            decompose naturally. Meal plans help reduce food wastage as you are able to eat everything you
                            planned without wastage. Using reusable containers instead of throwing them away reduces waste
                            produced. For example, reusing glass jars to store cooking items like salt/pepper. Buying high
                            quality items and learning to repair them when they are broken reduces waste as compared to using
                            disposable items that contributes to pollution. Water bottles and paper coffee cups are huge
                            wastes of material. Buy a durable water bottle and a cute coffee thermos so you can take your
                            beverages wherever you please. You’ll find yourself feeling a lot more hydrated and a lot less
                            wasteful.

                                There are many things you can reuse from everyday waste in your homes. Some examples are: Use a gallon milk jug to water
                                the roots of garden plants without standing there with a hose: Poke small holes in the bottom
                                of the jug and bury it; fill with water for slow and steady irrigation. Place old silica
                                gel packets with personal papers and important documents to protect them from moisture and
                                mildew. Humidity and light are deleterious to printed photos; tackle the moisture part by
                                storing photos with silica gel packets. You can also reuse water used to rinse rice to water
                                your plants as they are filled with nutrients. Furthermore, you could use bottle caps or
                                other items to decorate the walls of your room and fill less guilty about disposing the whole
                                thing. Now you may think, "What is the difference between this and recycling?". Well, reusing
                                is taking an item made for a purpose to make it fufill another purpose. Recycling is the
                                breaking down of used products to make raw materials for new products.

                            Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby
                            reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).Recyclable
                            materials include many kinds of glass, paper, and cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles,
                            and electronics. The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food or garden
                            waste—is also considered recycling. Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection
                            center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials
                            destined for manufacturing. Therefore, we are encouraged not to throw away recyclable materials
                            but instead throw them away into recycling bins so that they can be remade into other products.
                            For example, used office paper can be converted into new office paper while used polystyrene
                            foam can be made into new polystyrene.
